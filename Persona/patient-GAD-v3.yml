Story: 'As a 20-year-old female movie director, I find myself drowned in the ocean
  of my insecurities, particularly at work. Each day, despite no obvious signs of
  failure, a persistent thought haunts me: "I''m going to lose my job because I''m
  not competent enough." This fear grips me so strongly that I overcompensate by obsessing
  over minor details, triple-checking every task as if my life depends on it. The
  pressure I put on myself to be flawless has stolen my peace, leaving me tossing
  and turning at night, haunted by the possibility of mistakes that have yet to occur.
  It''s an exhausting cycle, driven by anxiety, that makes each workday a battle against
  my own pervasive fears of inadequacy.'
