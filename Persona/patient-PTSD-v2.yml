  PATIENT_AGE: '50'
  PATIENT_GENDER: Male
  PATIENT_OCCUPATION: veteran
  REACTION: I start to panic, my heart races, I sweat, and sometimes I freeze, unable
    to move.
  SITUATION: Hearing a loud noise that sounds like gunfire.
  SYMPTOM: PTSD
Story: 'Every time a car backfires or fireworks explode in the night sky, I''m instantly
  transported back to the battlefields from my past. The sound, so similar to gunfire,
  triggers an avalanche of automatic thoughts: I''m no longer safe, I''m back in the
  warzone. My body reacts before my mind can catch up; my heart pounds like it''s
  trying to break free, sweat drenches my skin, and fear chains me, rendering me immobile.
  In those moments, the line between past and present blurs, and I stand frozen, fighting
  a war that, for everyone else, ended years ago. Even though my surroundings are
  familiar and typically safe, the echoes of those noises convince me I''m facing
  a threat as real as any I encountered in uniform.'
