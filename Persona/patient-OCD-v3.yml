  AUTOMATIC_THOUGHT: If I don't wash my hands precisely 20 times, something terrible
    will happen.
  DESCRIPTION: The person experiences an overwhelming compulsion to wash their hands
    exactly 20 times every morning due to a belief that not doing so will cause a
    catastrophic event. This ritual dominates their morning routine, causing significant
    anxiety and disruption. Despite the urgency of other commitments, the fear of
    not completing the ritual perfectly forces them to restart the count if interrupted,
    leading to a cycle of washing and counting that serves as both a source of distress
    and a misguided comfort.

  SYMPTOM: OCD
Story: 'Every morning, as I get ready for work, my mind spins with an unshakeable
  thought: if I don''t wash my hands precisely 20 times, a catastrophic event will
  ensue. This conviction has me anchored to the sink, meticulously counting each wash,
  ensuring that not a single attempt falls short of perfection. The simple act of
  washing, which most breeze through, morphs into an intense ritual for me, with the
  cold faucet handle and the scent of soap becoming all too familiar comforts in a
  world of chaos. If I''m ever interrupted before reaching that crucial number, panic
  clenates its fist around my heart, urging me to restart the count, no matter the
  pressing demands of my job or the ticking clock. This relentless cycle of washing
  and counting dominates my mornings, leaving me ensnared in a web of anxiety that
  I''m perpetually trying to escape, but somehow, paralyzed by fear, I find solace
  in the ritual, convinced it''s the thin line between safety and disaster.'
