  AUTOMATIC_THOUGHT: If I don't check the door seven times, something terrible will
    happen to my home.
  DESCRIPTION: Every morning, the person experiences intense anxiety that compels
    them to check their door lock exactly seven times before leaving for the day.
    They are aware that this behavior is irrational, yet the fear of a disaster occurring
    if they don't follow through with the ritual is overpowering. Even after completing
    the ritual, they are plagued by doubt throughout the day, only finding relief
    upon returning home to confirm everything is in order.
  PATIENT_AGE: '30'
  PATIENT_GENDER: Female
  PATIENT_OCCUPATION: Designer
  REACTION: I repeatedly check the lock, feeling anxious and unable to leave until
    I've completed the ritual.
  SITUATION: Every time I leave my house, I have to check if the door is locked exactly
    seven times.
  SYMPTOM: OCD
Story: 'Every morning, as I grab my designer bag and head out for the day, a wave
  of anxiety crashes over me. The thought pounds in my head like a relentless drum:
  if I don''t check the door lock exactly seven times, some unforeseen disaster will
  strike my home. Despite the logical part of me whispering that it''s irrational,
  I''m gripped by an overwhelming fear that paralyzes me. So, I start my ritual, counting
  each click of the lock with careful precision. Only when I''ve reached the sacred
  number seven do I feel a temporary relief, but as I walk away, I can''t shake the
  nagging doubt that maybe, just maybe, I didn''t do it right, which turns my day
  into a cycle of worry until I can return home and ensure everything is as it should
  be.'
